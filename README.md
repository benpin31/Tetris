# Tetris
First Ironhack project : Tetris.

The project is playable on computer and phones. My principal prupose was to manipulate DOM (the game is not make with canvas) and learn how to use touch event.

# What remain to do

- Finish comments and refacto some part of the code
- Correct some (minor) bugs due to the interface
- Create a div of rules and commands 
- Improve collision gameplay : the tetrominos can't turn if collision with an other tetromino. Newer rules make it possible
- Add new themes (less retroâ€¦ bloodborne ?)
